# Military Base Patrol Rover

This repository contains the code and documentation for a military base patrol rover. The rover is designed to autonomously patrol a military base while avoiding any obstacles in its path. It utilizes various components including ultrasonic sensors, a motor driver, Arduino Uno, gear motors, and a battery.

## Components Used

- Ultrasonic Sensors: These sensors are used to detect obstacles in the rover's path.
- Motor Driver: The motor driver module controls the movement of the gear motors.
- Arduino Uno: The Arduino Uno microcontroller board serves as the brain of the rover, executing the patrol logic and controlling the sensors and motors.
- Gear Motors: These motors provide the necessary propulsion for the rover to move around.
- Battery: The battery powers the entire rover system, ensuring it has sufficient energy for autonomous patrolling.
